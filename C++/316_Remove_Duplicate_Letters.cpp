/*
Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once.
You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results
*/

// This question is the same as 1081: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/
// That is language variation.

/*
Approach: As the question suggests, We can greedily pick the characters which affect the answer
and can be picked in future where they may be coming after lower lexicographical characters.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
