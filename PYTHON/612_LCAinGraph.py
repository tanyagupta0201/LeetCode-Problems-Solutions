	Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

	According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

	Given the following binary search tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

	        _______3______
	       /              \
	    ___5__          ___1__
	   /      \        /      \
	   6      _2       0       8
	         /  \
	         7   4
	Example 1:

	Input: root, p = 5, q = 1
	Output: 3
	Explanation: The LCA of of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
